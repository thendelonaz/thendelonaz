I've enjoyed being being a software developer ever since I created a rat maze🐭 in scratch, after i became fascinated and wanted to learn more so I started learning languages like C, C++ and python. I am currently looking for a role in backend development idealy working with python and c++. I also know how to write html and css code with some knowledge in javascript.💻
